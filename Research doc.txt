-Things needed that I already understand
Sf::Sprite [setorigin] //sets the sprite position on the texture
Sf::Sprite [setposition] //sets the position of the sprite in the window
Sf::Sprite [settexturerectangle] //crops the sprite texture
Sf::Sprite [settexture] //assigns the sprite an allocated texture
SF::Texture [loadfromfile] //loads texture/font/sound files to be assigned or played
Sf::event [mousebuttonpressed, mousebuttonreleased] //used to detect user mouse press and releases

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-Things I need to research
Sf::Sprite [setRotation]
SF::Texture [setrepeated]
SF::mouse [left,right]
Sf::Event::mousebutton [x,y, button]
